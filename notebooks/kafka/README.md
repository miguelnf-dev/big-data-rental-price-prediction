### Kafka

The Kafka component includes two notebooks:
- `kafka_producer.ipynb`: This notebook generates fake housing data and sends it to a Kafka topic, simulating real-time data ingestion.
- `kafka_consumer.ipynb`: This notebook sets up a Kafka consumer to ingest data, process it, and store it in HDFS.
