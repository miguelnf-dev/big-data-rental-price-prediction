## Usage

### Create a New Conda Environment

Before running the project, it's recommended to create a new Conda environment to manage dependencies. You can do this using the following commands:

"conda create --name project-env python=3.8"

### Activate the Conda Environment

"conda activate project-env"

### Install Dependencies from 'requirements.txt'

"pip install -r requirements.txt"

### Run the Project 

With your Conda environment activated and dependencies installed, the various components of the project can now be run . 
Note: The code uses placeholders like 'CLUSTER_URL_HERE' for paths and URLs related to the college's cluster. You'll need to update these placeholders to work with a different HDFS environment.
